### Hi there 👋

I'm planning to study software development.
I have done an intership as a full stack developer (NodeJS, Vue, Handlebars.js).

- 🌱 I’m currently graduating at the HTL Pinkafeld
- ❤️ I love programming
- 🔭 I'd love to have more time for programming
- 👯 I’m most interested in 3D graphical programming
- 😄 Pronouns: she/her
- ⚡ Fun fact: Even though I love low-level programming my favourite language is JavaScript
